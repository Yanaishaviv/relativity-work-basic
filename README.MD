Working mainly on some of my relativity for 5 points in the bagrut.
Should be able to simulate how an observer would see a homogeneous universe, with the ability to change his speed. Everything runs from MainCode.java, in the package main. I would advise you to stay away from the draw package. most of the actual code is in constructs. Good luck! You'll need it.
