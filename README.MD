Working mainly on some of my relativity for 5 points in the bagrut.

Simulating how an observer would see a homogeneous universe, with the ability to change his speed. Everything runs from MainCode.java, in the package main. The "draw" folder contains code used to visualize the simulation but not any actual physics. the "constructs" folder contains most of the simulation, and is build with OOP, around EmptyUni, Planet, and Spaceship (which inherits from Planet).
